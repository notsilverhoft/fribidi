This directory contains sources for library routines which some users have
found to be missing on their machines.

Since some of this code is covered by the GNU General Public License, a copy
is included in the file COPYING.  Note that only those files in the c2man
distribution which explicitly state that they fall under the terms of this
license actually do so.

The getopt routines (needed for MSC on the PC, and for VMS) are adapted from
the GNU versions.
